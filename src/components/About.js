               <p>
               With 6+ years of Aircraft Maintenance Engineering under my belt, I yearned to learn something different. The spark that I was missing ignited the instant I started writing my first lines of code, hence, I decided to go all-in. For the time being, I am a full stack developer with great team spirit, big ambitions and enthusiastic for contributing in projects that solves real-world problems.
